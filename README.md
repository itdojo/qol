# qol (Quality of Life) Tools

This is a collection of tools I find useful.  Rather than having scripts spread all over the place on different computers, this is my effort to better organize my tools so that I can A) make use of them more regularly and B) imporve upon them as I learn to write better code.

How this repo is organized:

**[fresh-install](fresh-install/zsh_install.sh)** - Scripts in this folder are useful when I am doing a fresh install of Linux or MacOS.  The folder has Linux and MacOS subfolders for any scripts that are system-specific.  If the script is written to run on either OS, it will be in the root folder.

## Tool List

| Tool | Location | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **[zsh_install.sh](fresh-install/zsh_install.sh)** | [fresh-install/](fresh-install/)) | For MacOS or Linux (Debian).  Installs (if needed) and configures: Homebrew, zsh, oh-my-zsh, NerfFonts, the MesloLGS NF font family, powerlevel10k ZSH theme and and zsh extensions (zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-completions).
